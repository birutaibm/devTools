# File Splitter

Would you like to split lines of a large file into different files based on quantity of line?

If so, this is the tool you need.

Simply pass the input file name (including the path, of course) along with the desired output file name and the number of lines you want per file. Since multiple output files will be generated, the name you provide will be used as a base for all of them. The actual file names will follow the format `outputName.n.outputExtension`, where `n` is a sequential number starting from 1 to the total number of generated files. All generated files will be saved in the same directory as the output file name you provide.
