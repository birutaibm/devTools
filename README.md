# DevTools

If you're not a developer, this project is not for you. Sorry.

If you're a developer, welcome to you new toolbox. In this project, you'll find some utility classes for commom data manipulations that every developer needs.

There is no user interface. Since you're a dev, feel free to explore the tools, edit the `index.js` file to use the tool you need, and run `node .` in you terminal.

Of course, you can also copy the desired class into your project to build something more specific on top of it.

Do you have a utilitary tool that fits the purpose of this project? You're wellcome to contribute! Just please maintain the code style and architecture.

## Availble Tools:

- [Files/Splitter](instructions/Files/Splitter)

- [Files/SQL/SqlInsertEditor](instructions/Files/SQL/SqlInsertEditor)
